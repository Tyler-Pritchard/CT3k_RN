# Comedy Theater 3000 for React Native

Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Description

I didn't think I understood the Pew-Die-Pie Generation, but then I realized I watch Rifftrax, which is pretty much the same thing but for movies.  People don't just want to watch stuff-- they want to watch stuff with their friends.  This app is for people who love watching bad entertainment, and talking over it the whole time.
