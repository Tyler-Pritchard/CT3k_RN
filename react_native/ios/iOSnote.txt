Here are some steps to set up a Podfile in React Native:
Create a new folder for the project
Copy the existing iOS project to a folder called ios
cd into the ios subdirectory
Open Terminal
Navigate to the project directory
Add the command pod init to generate podfile
Save the Podfile in the root directory of your Xcode project
Add your library name into podfile as pod library name
Run the pod install command to install the specified dependencies 
You can find the Podfile in Xcode by opening the Pods item from the top level of your project view, where it should be a sibling (not a child) of your app. If it doesn't exist, you can do a quick build with the play button, or run pod install. The Pods item should then appear, with Podfile as the first item under it.
